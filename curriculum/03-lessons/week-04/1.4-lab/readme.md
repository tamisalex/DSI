## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Logistic regression (logit) is a classification modeling method, and one of the most popular and widely used learning algorithms. Use the breast cancer dataset to illustrate your understanding of Logistic Regression and predict classes.

## Exercise

#### Requirements
- Read in Breast Cancer Dataset
- Identify features and target
- Use logistic regression from Scikit-Learn

####Datasets

- [Breast cancer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data)

#### Deliverable

- The purpose of this lab is to practice performing Classifications using Logistic Regression.
- Demonstrate reading a data file, separating features and target, and fitting a logit model.
- Perform classifications (predictions) on new data

## Starter Code
- Python [Starter Code](./code/starter-code/week4-1.4-starter-cancer.ipynb)
- Bonus: [kNN Approach](./code/starter-code/week4-1.4-starter.ipynb)
